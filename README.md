# Learning code is a journey for life!

I'm an aspiring full stack web developer who also loves UX/UI design.
With over 21 years working as an architect and 3D artist, I'm currently the Head of 3D Operations at a company based in Hanoi, Vietnam. In July 2022 I started learning to code. A curiosity that led me to start learning Python many years ago, a path that ended too soon due to the lack of time, consistency and impostor syndrome.  

## Current skills:
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript
- (in construction)
